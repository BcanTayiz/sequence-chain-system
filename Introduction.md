# Sequence Systems

I have not properly defined the concept but, eventually this system could be called as **recursive constraint-driven sequence** this name could be more different.

The name could be **self-regenative sequence systems**. This name sounds good and close to more biologically accurate process.

We may call our bodies and animals and organisms such that. However they are just the product of this recursive self-regenative sequence systems. 

Deep Learning and its variations are also kind of these systems self-regenative sequence systems or concept of **name**...

## Algorithm

* Algorithm starts with a node and  value,
* if another value relation with it result is 0, 
* It works like Boltzman machine,
* Eventually it calculates other nodes.


## Genetic Algorithm and Differences

Genetic algorithm when we create a changing string or dynamic, however this is different than that. This is a changing sequence of system and finds relationship from problem space...
