# Sequence Systems

I have not properly defined the concept but, eventually this system could be called as **recursive constraint-driven sequence** this name could be more different.

The name could be **self-regenative sequence systems**. This name sounds good and close to more biologically accurate process.

We may call our bodies and animals and organisms such that. However they are just the product of this recursive self-regenative sequence systems. 

Deep Learning and its variations are also kind of these systems self-regenative sequence systems or concept of **name**...

## Algorithm

* Algorithm starts with a node and  value,
* if another value relation with it result is 0, 
* It works like Boltzman machine,
* Eventually it calculates other nodes.


## Genetic Algorithm and Differences

Genetic algorithm when we create a changing string or dynamic, however this is different than that. This is a changing sequence of system and finds relationship from problem space...

Actually it is very similar to genetic algorithm. However, the real difference and my aim was to create a sequence changing system. However, for the pattern recognition this could not be the case.


## My Motive

I have been trying to classify and write meaningfull concept to understand adifferent problem. Then, this idea is a came up **seqence changing system** idea which is a concept and method covers many approaches.

## Sequence Changing Systems

Like **DNA** or **CODE** or **DEEP LEARNING**[1] or **GENETIC ALGORITHM** or **SUDOKU GAME** methods, sequence changing systems, we try to alter a system.

Actually, I was trying to give example about sudoku and then, I started to realize that many systems are like ***altering sequences***

What are those altering sequences ? 

It is cellular automata type of connection however adaptive system. For instance we have two cell a and b, then when a changes b and changes

We can set this as binary system. THen, a->b then b->a this is a solid system

For three elements, **as circuits** when a becomes b, b becomes a 

abc -> bac --> bab the automata system c connected to a change and there are altering secret rules behind the system.

## Cellular Automata Relationship

We desing some rules for classes and from these classes, the states or objects change their value according to total system. This is a **complex system** dynamic, where one cell tries adapt and connect many things as well.

## Simple Idea

<p style="color:orange">Actually, I designed an algorithm similar to kmeans, which is an unsupervised learning method. However, my main motive was to design a sequence system and adaptive complex system agent.  </p>

<p style="color:coral">This concept seem part of an cellular automata system. Therefore, the example and usage of cellular automata to machine learning and creating a code chunk to solve the pattern recognition comes to new to me. Therefore, I saw this idea unique. However it is a part of Cellular Automata Theory.  [3]</p>
