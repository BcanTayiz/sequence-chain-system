# Sequence Systems and Cellular Automata

Cellular Automata has been great topic for complex systems. However its functionality and place could not be found properly in last years.Therefore, I couldn't find any code regarding this study. I have prepared and demonstrated how the algorithm works in this repo.

The resources[1] and[2] shows that, this is a open field that can I parcipate much because the article and content largely but solutions are in less number.
