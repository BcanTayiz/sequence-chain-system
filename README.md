# Sequence Systems and Cellular Automata

Cellular Automata has been great topic for complex systems. However its functionality and place could not be found properly in last years.Therefore, I couldn't find any code regarding this study. I have prepared and demonstrated how the algorithm works in this repo.

The resources[1] and[2] shows that, this is a open field that can I parcipate much because the article and content largely but solutions are in less number.

## Swarm Intelligence - [informed_feedback](informed_feedback_system.ipynb)

Eventually one central system and information flow, I created a swarm intelligence system. Every system is an object and holds a row, or informative, actually they can learn and systematically analyze the rows with decision trees...

Eventually this could be a mixed Random Forest algorithm. My aim is to collective calculation system and divide the algorithm into small parts as **divide and conquer** or **dynamical programming** system.
